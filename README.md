Running model 1 and model 2:

Model 1: 

python model_1.py will run IBM model 1. Please use the following arguments to run the model correctly.
"--english_file_name", a pointer to the to the English sentences file.
"--french_file_name", a pointer to the to the french sentences file.
"--size", set the size of the corpus that we want to read. size is float and it describes the percent amount of data to read.
"--output_parameter_file_name", The parameter file to be generated by the end of training, it only saves the last iteration.
"--number_of_iterations" the number of iterations to run
"--verbose" whether you want to see output throughout the training, i.e. the current iteration number. 


Here is the command I'm using to run model 1. 
python model_1.py --english_file_name ../data/hansards.e
 --french_file_name ../data/hansards.f --size 85 --output_parameter_file_name "output.json" --number_of_iterations 10 
 --verbose True



For me the Null word is the last index in each french sentence. 
Also, I don't print an alignment to the Null word.
