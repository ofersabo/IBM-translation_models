Running model 1 and model 2:

Model 1: 

python model_1.py will run IBM model 1. Please use the following arguments to run the model correctly.
"--english_file_name", a pointer to the to the English sentences file.
"--french_file_name", a pointer to the to the french sentences file.
"--size", set the size of the corpus that we want to read. size is float and it describes the percent amount of data to read.
"--output_parameter_file_name", The parameter file to be generated by the end of training, it only saves the last iteration.
"--number_of_iterations" the number of iterations to run
"--verbose" whether you want to see output throughout the training, i.e. the current iteration number. 
"--output_parameters_every_epoch" whether you want to store the parameters after every iteration

Here is the command I'm using to run model 1. 
python model_1.py --english_file_name ../data/hansards.e
 --french_file_name ../data/hansards.f --size 85 --output_parameter_file_name "output.json" --number_of_iterations 10 
 --verbose True


Model 2:
python model_2.py runs the IBM model 2. 
please use the above same arguments when running this script, just for a single exception.
Model_2 as an option to initialize the alignments from model_1 output.
To use this please specify the argument: --initialization_file towards a output from get_alignments.py txt file, 
which was produced by a model 1 parameters. 



Alignment:
To get the alignment file use the python script called get_alignments.py 

python get_alignments.py gets three arguments: 
First argument is the english file txt
second argument is the french file txt 
Third argument is the parameters file of either model 1 or model 2. the get alignments handles both parameters file.
Fourth argument is the output alignment file.
Fifth argument, verbose: use as false when testing, it outputs an periodic output to screen to see progress, also outputs to the same file an intermediate result after 5000 sentences.

This is an example how to run the get_alignments.py:
python get_alignments.py data/english.txt data/french.txt parameters_output.json my_alignment.txt false 





For me the Null word is the last index in each french sentence. 
Also, I don't print an alignment to the Null word.
